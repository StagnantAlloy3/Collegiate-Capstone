<h2>1.3.2 Server-side Endpoint for Manual Item Search</h2>
<hr>
<small>These manual tests, or the ByNameQueryTest java code can be run to validate the endpoint.  The automated java code 
can be found in /FoodAPI/test/ByNameQueryTest.  Testing can also be done from the React UI, but endpoint results are not 
available for view, only formulated response by React.</small>
<h3>Acceptance Test 1: Query for a known food fdc_id</h3>
<p>Tests the endpoint for a valid response provided a known-good search term</p>
<ol>
<li>Using postman, send a GET request to the endpoint /by-name with the itemname being "Pork Loin Boneless" (http://localhost:8080/FoodAPI_war_exploded/api/items/by-name?itemname=Pork Loin Boneless)</li>
<li>Response should be a JSON-formatted string matching what is found in the test class (exempt from the .md for sake of readability, as it's quite long.)
</li>
</ol>
<small>Other item names can be used.  In general, we're looking to make sure that 1) A valid JSON object is returned and 2)
The fields fdc_id and description are present.</small>

<h3>Acceptance Test 2: Query for a bad name</h3>
<p>Tests the endpoint for handling a bad input.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the same endpoint as test 1, query with special characters.  This is somewhat difficult, as the database is incredibly 
lage and with many items including special characters. What we're looking for is input coming back as empty, and never receiving 
an error message from tomcat.
</ol>
